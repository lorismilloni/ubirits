# Ubirits
App made on october, 2022. With error in route fixed to push to this repository.

## This is one of my first complete apps using JavaScript. Developed during a two week bootcamp, me and three colleagues were responsible for creating the backend and frontend to a beer delivery store. We learned how to work as a team and used Kanban to organize our tasks. Our context story was to create an app to a local store that was growing and needed an online page to receive and control orders and orders status. The client should be able to create a profile, select products an see the current status of the order, as well mark as arrived. While the seller should be able to create a vendor profile, an update the order state.
Unfortunately this project was developed in a private repository and I wasn't able to retreive my commit history.

## We used JavaScript, React, Reactstrap for styling and Sequelize for managing the database using MVC architecture.

#### To be able to see my project running:

- download the repo;
- inside folder **front-end** type `npm install` and press enter in your terminal;
- inside folder **back-end** type `npm install` and press enter in your terminal;
- you are going to need a SQL instance in your computer, I use MySQL inside a Docker container, but you can download and use MySQL as a standalone app, be sure to configure your .env file with your info, there is a .env.example file for you, just add your local user and password.
- type `npm start` in the **back-end** folder and press enter;
